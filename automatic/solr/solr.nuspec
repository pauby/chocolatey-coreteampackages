<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->
<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->
<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Solr is the popular, blazing-fast, open source enterprise search platform built on Apache Lucene.</summary>
    <description>Solr is a standalone enterprise search server with a REST-like API. You put documents in it (called "indexing") via JSON, XML, CSV or binary over HTTP. You query it via HTTP GET and receive JSON, XML, CSV or binary results.

## Features

- Advanced Full-Text Search Capabilities
- Optimized for High Volume Traffic
- Standards Based Open Interfaces - XML, JSON and HTTP
- Comprehensive Administration Interfaces
- Easy Monitoring
- Highly Scalable and Fault Tolerant
- Flexible and Adaptable with easy configuration
- Near Real-Time Indexing
- Extensible Plugin Architecture
- Schema when you want, schemaless when you don't
- Powerful Extensions
- Faceted Search and Filtering
- Geospatial Search
- Advanced Configurable Text Analysis
- Highly Configurable and User Extensible Caching
- Performance Optimizations
- Secure Solr with SSL, Authentication and Role based Authorization
- Advanced Storage Options (codecs, directories and more)
- Monitorable Logging
- Query Suggestions, Spelling and More
- JSON, CSV, XML and more are supported out of the box.
- Rich Document Parsing via Apache Tika
- Integrates into Apache UIMA
- Multiple search indices

## Package Parameters

- `/InstallDir` - Install/unpack to a custom location. Chocolatey will remove files from this custom location on uninstall but **WILL NOT** upgrade files in this custom location without using the `/InstallDir` parameter again.

## Notes

- **This software in this package _requires_ a minimum of version 11 of a Java Runtime Engine. It will not work without one.** As there are so many flavours of Java I leave it to you to choose the one your prefer. My current recommendation is [Temurin](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Temurinjre) if you don't already have one installed. See the [Solr Java Requirements](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/system-requirements.html#java-requirements) for more information.
- The Solr binaries are extracted to the `solr-VERSION_NUMBER` folder of the installation location (by default `c:\tools` - see [`Get-ToolsLocation`](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/get-toolslocation) for more information). See the `/InstallDir` parameter above for custom install location.
- **If the package is out of date please check [Version History](#versionhistory) for the latest submitted version. If you have a question, please ask it in [Chocolatey Community Package Discussions](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages/discussions) or raise an issue on the [Chocolatey Community Packages Repository](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-packages/issues) if you have problems with the package. Disqus comments will generally not be responded to.**    </description>
